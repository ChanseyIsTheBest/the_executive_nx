 *
 * The engine derives its timebase from it:

 *     CCounter::GetPerformanceCounter()  -> mach_continuous_time() -> NANOSECONDS
 *     CCounter::GetPerformanceFrequency() -> 1e9 / clock_getres().tv_nsec
 *     CCounter::GetSecs()                 -> counter / frequency
 *
 * The counter is already in nanoseconds, so the only frequency that makes
 * GetSecs() correct is 1e9 -- which requires tv_nsec == 1. That is exactly
 * what bionic returns for CLOCK_MONOTONIC on Android, the platform this engine
 * was built and tuned against.
 *
 * An earlier version returned 6, reasoning that it should report "the real
 * hardware tick rather than claiming 1 ns and having the engine compute a
 * nonsense frame budget". That was backwards: the engine is not asking how
 * precise the clock is, it is asking for the divisor that converts its
 * nanosecond counter to seconds. Returning 6 made the frequency 166,666,666
 * instead of 1,000,000,000, so every CCounter-derived duration ran SIX TIMES
 * fast. (The 6 was not even right on its own terms -- the Switch system
 * counter is 19.2 MHz, or 52 ns, not the 192 MHz the comment claimed.)

/* Cross-referencing every PLT call site in libexecutive_android.so shows mmap is reached
 * from exactly ONE function -- FreeType's FT_Stream_Open, mapping a font file
 * read-only -- and munmap from exactly one, ft_close_stream_by_munmap.
 * Nothing else in the game maps anything, and mprotect/madvise/mremap are not
 * imported at all.
 *
 * libc_shim's arena is roughly 700 lines written for Unity. Its own comment
 * says why: Unity reserves big aligned pools by over-mapping and then
 * munmapping the head and tail, so a plain malloc/free per mmap would free the
 * whole block when the head is trimmed. FreeType does none of that. It maps a
 * file, reads it, and unmaps exactly what it mapped.
 *
 * Serving that with the Unity machinery produced three separate failures here:
 * an unbreakable infinite loop when the granule was left at zero; the
 * over-map/trim path being taken for a 3.2 MB font because the threshold sat
 * below it; and a large arena carved out of the same newlib heap the engine
 * allocates from, after which malloc(400) returned an unmapped address and
 * FT_Init_FreeType failed.
 *
 * The requirement is: allocate, fill from the file, remember the size, free on
 * unmap. That is what this does. The arena code stays in the tree, unmodified
 * and unused, so upstream fixes can still be pulled into it.
