/* compat_stubs.h -- satisfies the headers libc_shim.c and so_util.c include.
 *
 * MIT licensed. See LICENSE.
 *
 * libc_shim.c is reused unmodified from the reference ports -- it carries the
 * bionic struct stat translation, the mmap emulation and around 120 correct
 * shims -- but there it is wired into headers belonging to those games:
 *
 *     sj_paths.h  asset_pack.h  bsd_bridge.h  sj_trace.h  fakefd.h  imports.h
 *
 * The Executive needs none of what they declare. It reads plain files from a real
 * directory (there is no APK asset pack: AssetList.getAssetFiles is never
 * referenced from native, so the Java side had already extracted assets/ to
 * the data dir), it opens no fake descriptors, and libexecutive_android.so imports no
 * socket symbols at all -- checked against its .dynsym.
 *
 * So those headers are one-line forwarders to this one and compat_stubs.c
 * gives every symbol a trivial body, letting libc_shim.c drop in untouched --
 * which is what allows fixes to be pulled back from upstream.
 *
 * Two things this file learned the hard way, both recorded so they are not
 * relearned:
 *
 *   1. The prototypes are copied verbatim from the reference headers, not
 *      retyped. An earlier draft guessed and produced eight silent signature
 *      mismatches: asset_pack_dir_is takes a directory handle rather than a
 *      path, and asset_pack_fstat_fd takes four arguments rather than two.
 *
 *   2. The list of symbols is derived from the undefined symbols of the built
 *      libc_shim.o, not from reading its includes. Reading the includes missed
 *      asset_pack_read_all_path, nx_socket and firebase_stub_lookup, none of
 *      which would have surfaced until the link.
 *
 * NOTE: nx_addr_readable and managed_path are deliberately absent. The first
 * is static inside libc_shim.c; the second is declared by libc_shim.h and
 * defined in libc_shim.c. Declaring either here would be a duplicate.

/* libc_shim.c's mmap emulation consults these.
 *
 * g_mmap_big_align MUST BE A NON-ZERO POWER OF TWO. It is not an "alignment
 * hint" that can be switched off, which is what an earlier version of this
 * comment claimed, and setting it to 0 hung the port for six test cycles:
 *
 *     libc_shim.c:1248   const size_t step = MMAP_BIG_ALIGN / MMAP_PAGE;
 *     libc_shim.c:1251   for (size_t i = 0; i + need <= mmap_pages; i += step)
 *
 * With big_align 0 the step is 0 and the scan never advances -- an infinite
 * loop with no syscall, no allocation and no I/O, which is why every counter
 * froze and the console sat at 100% CPU. And because MMAP_BIG_THRESH is
 * #defined to the same value, `len >= MMAP_BIG_THRESH` was `len >= 0`, so
 * *every* mmap took that path. The first one never returned.
 *
 * The reference port derives these from an __libnx_initheap override. This
 * port deliberately does not override initheap -- libnx's default claims all
 * available memory via svcSetHeapSize, which is both more memory and less to
 * go wrong -- so exec_mmap_arena_init() carves the arena out of that heap
 * instead. */
